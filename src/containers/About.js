            I’m a simple person who enjoys simple things of life. A good coffee
            and a good music, and it’s all set to work. If I’m not coding,
            studying or researching better ways to work, I’m cooking, preparing
            an espresso or spending free time with my wife and daughter. I’m
            also a problem-solver/fixer type of guy. I love to fix things and
            help people. It doesn’t matter the problem, I’m always ready to give
            a hand.

            I’ve been creating web and e-learning content for almost 18 years
            now. I started in the tech world on an Intel 80386 at the age of 8,
            coding in Microsoft BASIC. As a professional I’m experienced in
            different languages and tools: ActionScript 3, Java, ASP, PHP, SQL,
            Javascript, among others. AS3 and JS being the ones I used the most
            throughout the years. Having worked closely with different
            professionals such as UX/UI designers, instructional designers,
            copywriters, frontend and backend developers, I acquired valuable
            knowledge on how to combine technical, business and user
            requirements into creative and efficient products.

            <br />
            After 8 years working in web development and e-learning industry, I
            started my own company in 2009, through which I had the pleasure to
            work with companies such as Kraft Foods, Electrolux, Volvo Motors,
            HSBC Bank, Furukawa Electric, GP Strategies, Metlife, Boticário
            Group. During this time I developed a broad range of skills:
            team-leading, mentoring, project management, entrepreneurship,
            finances, accounting, business laws and others. For more than 7
            years, I planned, collaborated with teams and managed hundreds of
            successful e-learning, web and digital design projects with great
            commitment to deliver high-quality designs and products to the
            customers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I work as a freelance E-learning and Front-end Developer
            in Curitiba/PR, Brazil.
