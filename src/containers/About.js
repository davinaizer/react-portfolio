            I’m a simple person who enjoys simple things of life. A good coffee and a good music, and it’s all set to
            work. If I’m not coding, studying or researching better ways to work, I’m cooking, preparing an espresso or
            spending free time with my wife and daughter. I’m also a problem-solver/fixer type of guy. I love to fix
            things and help people. It doesn’t matter the problem, I’m always ready to give a hand.

            I’ve been creating web and e-learning content for almost 18 years now. I started in the tech world on an
            Intel 80386 at the age of 8, coding in Microsoft BASIC. As a professional I’m experienced in different
            languages and tools: ActionScript 3, Java, ASP, PHP, SQL, Javascript, among others. AS3 and JS being the
            ones I used the most throughout the years. Having worked closely with different professionals such as UX/UI
            designers, instructional designers, copywriters, frontend and backend developers, I acquired valuable
            knowledge on how to combine technical, business and user requirements into creative and efficient products.
            <br />
            <br />
            After 8 years working in web development and e-learning industry, I started my own company in 2009, through
            which I had the pleasure to work with companies such as Kraft Foods, Electrolux, Volvo Motors, HSBC Bank,
            Furukawa Electric, GP Strategies, Metlife, Boticário Group. During this time I developed a broad range of
            skills: team-leading, mentoring, project management, entrepreneurship, finances, accounting, business laws
            and others. For more than 7 years, I planned, collaborated with teams and managed hundreds of successful
            e-learning, web and digital design projects with great commitment to deliver high-quality designs and
            products to the customers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Currently, I work as a Frontend Developer at Gamesys, a company based in London/UK.
